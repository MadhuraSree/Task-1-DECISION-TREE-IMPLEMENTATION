# Task-1-DECISION-TREE-IMPLEMENTATION

DECISION TREE IMPLEMENTATION

## About the Project

This project focuses on implementing a **Decision Tree Classifier** to perform classification on a well-known dataset using the `scikit-learn` library. The goal is to learn how decision trees split data, make predictions, and how we can visualize those decisions clearly.
The task is part of the **CodTech Machine Learning Internship** program and demonstrates practical use of supervised machine learning techniques for classification problems.

✨ Project Features

- Uses the **Iris dataset** (preloaded in scikit-learn)
- Trains a **Decision Tree Classifier**
- Splits data into training and test sets
- Predicts iris species based on flower measurements
- Calculates and displays **accuracy score**
- **Visualizes** the trained decision tree using `matplotlib`
